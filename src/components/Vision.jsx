        <p className='visionP'> This isnt 2009. Your phone doesnt have a floppy drive, and it shouldnt have a headphone connector either. When we made iPhone 6 and 6s, the world wasnt ready for the future. Now, it is. Apple Plug is the perfect solution. Fill in your archaic headphone connector with beautiful aluminium and plug yourself into the future. </p>
